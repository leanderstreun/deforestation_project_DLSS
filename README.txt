CNN for Detecting Deforestation

The present repository contains the materials related to the final team project of the course "Deep Learning for the Social Sciences (DLSS)". In the code "0_forest_detection_chaco" can be found the image preprocessing, model training, model evaluation for the region of Chaco Argentina. Change detection algorithm can be found in "1_forest_change_detection_chaco". 

Although we found a binary classification of "forest" vs. "no_forest" best fitting for our objective of finding forest loss between two different time points, we first analysed the possibility of building a multilable classifier. The steps taken for constructing it can be found in "1_multilable_image_prepro" and "2_multilable_training".

All the inputs and outputs for the Chaco project presented in the report can be found in the "pictures_masks", "models" and "report_figures" folders.
